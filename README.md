## Hi there, I'm Nathan! ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing my M.S. degree in Weather and Climate Risk and Data Analytics from UIUC!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and end-to-end open science best practices! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm left-handed, I've been to 49/50 U.S. States, and I'm a meteorologist!
